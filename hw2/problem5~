The returned LinkedList is [5,4,3,2,1]
The input of the last recursion in funcA should be pointer pointing to the
last element of the inputed Linked List, which is 5. This pointer is returned 
to "out" and now "in" is pointing to the last second element which is 4.
Then move to funcB. 
in2 -> next == NULL. So in2->next = in1; which make 5->next point back to 4.
Then back to funcA.
in->next = NULL. It makes 4->next = NULL; 
Then trace back to previous recursion where in points to 3 and out points to 4;
Similarly, move to funcB; It make 4->next = 3 and 3->next = NULL;
As a result, the entire function A and B aims to reverse the inputed linked list, 
so the final ouputed linked list is [5,4,3,2,1];
